        <h1>Laptop Recon Work</h1>
        <h2>Planning a Repair</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        My husband got a refurbished computer a few years ago. I helped him pick
        out a cool HP laptop that he loves being on and has rad adventures on
        it. Itâ€™s a good computer overall, but it has severely needed some work
        in the past year. The case started to crack. I tried to do touch-ups
        with heat, JB weld, and an old credit card cut into the right size with
        a Dremel tool. I soon realized that I had not addressed the problem of
        why the plastic was cracking. I erroneously thought the plastic was
        weak. The issue as to why the thing is breaking down is the tension in
        HPâ€™s hinges is too tight. I found other people having the same issues
        all over the internet. Iâ€™m on a quest as my husband needs a new case and
        has requested a new battery too. I need to do recon work to get the
        details to repair correctly this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These were my touch ups that did nothing. I can't even close the laptop
        at this point because of the hinges.

        First, I backed up the hard drive before taking it apart. As shown in
        the picture, I back him up regularly to a Western Digital drive. Always
        back up your files before repairs! In general, perform regular backups.
        You never know when those backups might save your bacon.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, how do you work on a delicate laptop you canâ€™t close? Carefully, I
        flipped it so the monitor portion faced downward and the case part was
        upside down on a tv tray table jutted against my stove. I made sure to
        wear my antistatic wrist band too.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        I took a picture of the model number as that would help me get parts
        later.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had to unscrew the screws on the back. I had to get the disk drive
        free and remove the screws under the disk drive.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/get disk drive out.jpg"
        alt="get disk drive out"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        My fingers are where the two screws were. I had removed them at this
        point.
      </p>
      <img

        alt="where the screws were"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        I then gently, with a flat head screw driver, pried the edges of the
        back cover free. I was greeted with this.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/inside.jpg"

        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed was the plastic around the hinges were shot.
        As you can see in the below pics there is plastic shrapnel.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/broke hinge.jpg"
        alt="a broke hinge"
        width="500"

      />
      <img
        src="pictures/broke hinge2.jpg"
        alt="a broke hinge"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        I got the canned air out and shot the shrapnel away. I also used it to
        get most of the dust out of the fan. I plan to give the CPU fan a good
        cleaning when I'm doing the repair.
      </p>
      <img

        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        Then I looked at the battery. I unscrewed and removed it and took a
        bunch of pics of it.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/battery screwed down.jpg"
        alt="unscrew it"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <img
        src="pictures/get battery out.jpg"
        alt="getting battery out"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <img
        src="pictures/up close battery.jpg"
        alt="up close"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <img
        src="pictures/battery info.jpg"
        alt="battery info"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        With the pictures, I saw that the battery I needed was an HP HT03XL, and
        a note said I needed to replace it with L11119-855. Taking pics is
        always better than a Post-it. I do this in case I write down a wrong
        number or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew from doing homework on this repair that to determine the case, I
        would have to look under the battery where the touchpad is. The number
        on the touchpadâ€™s sticker determines the correct case to order.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/info to replace plastic.jpg"
        alt="replace case"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        I had what I needed. I put the componets back and screwed it up. I then
        booted it on.
      </p>
      <img
        src="pictures/it booted.jpg"
        alt="replace case"
        width="500"
        height="auto"
      />
      <p>
        Heck yeah! It booted! I ordered the parts and am going to pull off the
        repair upon delivery. I made sure to get an OEM part for the battery. I
        always do that. The case is aftermarket. I'm going to losen and
        lubricate the hinges so we're not back here again. Hopefully the new
        plastic is tough. My screw driver to do the work was a phillips 1. I
        used my Star Trek one as I wanted the force to be with me. I think it
        was. This is going to be cool.
